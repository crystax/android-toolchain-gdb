# Speed up some gdb operations when working with gdbserver.
# This tells gdb it can use the contents of read-only sections
# from local copies of binaries instead of having to read target memory.
# FIXME: Sigh.  This slows down getting to main because target_section_by_addr
# does a linear scan over all sections, and is called for each
# target_read_partial.  Disabled for now.  http://b/1935021

# The rest of this file is written in python.
